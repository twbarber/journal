# Purpose

I'd like to log my progress on different goals I've set for 2017. I may end up making these logs more presentable as part of a project later on, but for now this Git repository with text files will do.

## Books

One of the things I'd like to accomplish this year is reading more. I'd like to consume more technical books, in order to improve my skill set as an engineer, but I'd also like to read more for pleasure. I've set the bar at one technical book per month, and one non-technical book per week. I've chosen the following books for the month of January:

### Technical

**Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide** : Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Hardy, and Kristin Marsicano 

I've wanted to really dive into Android Programming for quite some time. I think I've finished maybe 1/5th of this book 3 times over, but could never see it through to completion. Finishing this book is a first step in another goal to publish an  Android application to the Google Play Store by the end of the year.

### Non-Technical

**Brave New World** : Aldous Huxley

'Fahrenheit 451' by Ray Bradbury and '1984' by George Orwell are two of my favorite novels. I've got a particular interest in dystopian futures, and Huxley's 'Brave New World' is one that gets mentioned quite often alongside these two. What I found most interesting about 'Brave New World' is that the "control" the government has on its citizens is, at least partially, self inflicted. Huxley appears to have more closely guessed what modern civilization is moving towards.

**Mythical Man Month** : Fred Brooks

Another book I've started and never finished. A collection of Essays on software engineering, published in 1975, this is still recommended as a cornerstone for Software Engineering literature. The overarching theme of "adding resources to a late project makes it later" is still very relevant in my industry experience.

**Algorithms to Live By** : Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths

I came across this book on an episode of Software Engineering Daily. Jeff Meyerson interviews the Author, Brian Christian, about the research that went into the book. The approach of creating analogs from algorithms and data structures to decisions we make in real life seems like it'd be a great read.  		

**The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three** : Steven King

I read the first Dark Tower Book last year, and want to see how Roland's story progresses. I'd like to finish this entire series by the end of the year.

## Progress Today

So far I've created the public GitHub repository for the Big Nerd Ranch opening project 'GeoQuiz', figured out which other books I'd like to read this month, and wrote this post. I'd like to tackle the first 4 Chapters of BNR tomorrow, as well as a few chapters in Brave New World.
